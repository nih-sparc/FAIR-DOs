# FAIR DOs: Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable Development of Open Simulation
## Overview of Research Education Program
FAIR DOs (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable: Development Of Simulations) is a research education program in the modeling and simulation of digestive and renal neurobiology. The main thrust of FAIR DOs is to educate the next generation of researchers and clinicians in the neural regulation of digestive and renal epithelia through taught modules and supervised modeling projects that make use of SPARC datasets, maps, and models. Overall, FAIR DOs aims to provide about 35/45 hours of training to students, with each student research project producing one publication in the Physiome journal--launched by the International Union of Physiological Sciences. The SPARC Portal will provide findability to these student- generated open-access models and associated data, as well as accessible interactivity via the O2S2PARC simulation platform. Overall, the FAIR DOs effort will provide a unique educational, mentored experience that will also generate a SPARC ecosystem of interoperating models that coherently study the neurobiology of digestive and renal epithelial transport. From a didactic “Systems” perspective, this ecosystem of models will be organized to follow the teaching narrative of the British Medical Association “Medical Physiology 3rd Ed.” textbook, supplemented with recent literature, setting the stage to further leverage SPARC resources for education in the future.
